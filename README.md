## Approved Project Functionality

Approved by: Kano

- Allows users to sign in/ signout / create a user / have profile pages that links to what they've contributed
- Allows users to write news articles and post pictures with the articles
- Allows users to create genres for their articles and each genre has its own page that conglomerates all the articles
  written for that genre
- Allow comments on each article
- Allows forums/discussions on each genre
- Allows moderators for specific genres who can remove articles and forum posts.
- I would like some sort of "like" functionality for articles--up-votes/down-votes if you want, but something for
  immediate reactions
